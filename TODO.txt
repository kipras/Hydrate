- For 1.x and later:
    - Add support for recursive relations.
        For example in kritikai we have nodes, nodes can have categories (relation to node itself) and categories
        can have parent categories (site types) which results in another relaton to node. I need to test
        for such a situation and see if it works, and if not - add this feature to Hydrate.
      UPDATE: they already work (checked in 1.8)


- For tests/ :
    - When exporting sql, check for an existing sql with the same contents (probably can be speeded up,
        by adding a file size check first, and only checking for contents once we found a file with the
        same size as our newly generated sql).
    - Go through tests/hydrate.test.php and write tests, that have a TODO.

- Connect Ucache (with memcached backend only) to it.
    - Also, create cache invalidations, when write queries are run through Hydrate.
        Although should probably only include write queries run through the AR api, not direct queries
        (parsing them is eughh...)
    - But, we should also do these cache invalidations in a way, that we actually would have invalidation
        functions, that we could call from the outside if necessary (say if we are updating something, but we
        can't go through Hydrate, we should still be able to invalidate it's corresponding caches).
    - But make sure that cache invalidations are selective, i.e. if we update one item in a table, we don't want
        to invalidate all caches that have anything to do with that table.
    
    Anyway, this will be difficult... (But would be really awesome if we had this)
