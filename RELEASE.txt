1.10  - Added some preprocessing for where() clauses - you can now do where('a !=', NULL)
        and it will translate to 'a IS NOT NULL'.
        Note that CI does only where('a', NULL) -> 'a IS NULL' (it does not support the IS NOT version).
1.9   - Small fixes and additional checks
1.8   - Added Hydrate_query->countQuery()
1.7   - Now always uses Services_JSON library to parse the json file, instead of the native json_decode(),
        because it is more error-tolerant and less restrictive than native json_decode()
1.6   - Small fix for schema file reading
1.5   - Same chage as 1.2.2 but for 1.4
1.4   - Same chage as 1.2.1 but for 1.3
1.3   - Completely independent of Code Igniter (older versions could only be used in CI projects)
        - Now you can pass the CI AR instance to Hydrate directly.
        - You can also put the schema in the current.schema file directly, if you want (as opposed to
            only putting a pointer to the current schema file there. Putting a pointer also works.

1.2.2 - Fixed an error on MS SQL, which would come up, when there is limit() and more than one order_by()
1.2.1 - Allows to pass Hydrate->where() raw SQL queries in parentheses, i.e. Hydrate->where("(x AND y)")
1.2   - order_by() can now be called multiple times, to order by several fields
