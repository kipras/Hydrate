2.0   - Added where() clause escaping. Could not add it to 1.x branch, because it broke some tests of 1.x,
        because escaping is turned on by default, and some constructs would get escaped and that would brake
        things. For example Hydrate->where("a.x IN (1,2)") would get escaped to Hydrate->where("a.x IN '(1,2)'").
        You can now get the same functionality with: Hydrate->where("a.x IN (1,2)", NULL, FALSE).


1.10  - Added some preprocessing for where() clauses - you can now do where('a !=', NULL)
        and it will translate to 'a IS NOT NULL'.
        Note that CI does only where('a', NULL) -> 'a IS NULL' (it does not support the IS NOT version).
1.9   - Small fixes and additional checks
1.8   - Added Hydrate_query->countQuery()
1.7   - Now always uses Services_JSON library to parse the json file, instead of the native json_decode(),
        because it is more error-tolerant and less restrictive than native json_decode()
1.6   - Small fix for schema file reading
1.5   - Same chage as 1.2.2 but for 1.4
1.4   - Same chage as 1.2.1 but for 1.3
1.3   - Completely independent of Code Igniter (older versions could only be used in CI projects)
        - Now you can pass the CI AR instance to Hydrate directly.
        - You can also put the schema in the current.schema file directly, if you want (as opposed to
            only putting a pointer to the current schema file there. Putting a pointer also works.

1.2.2 - Fixed an error on MS SQL, which would come up, when there is limit() and more than one order_by()
1.2.1 - Allows to pass Hydrate->where() raw SQL queries in parentheses, i.e. Hydrate->where("(x AND y)")
1.2   - order_by() can now be called multiple times, to order by several fields
