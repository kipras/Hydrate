1.5   - Same chage as 1.2.2 but for 1.4
1.4   - Same chage as 1.2.1 but for 1.3
1.3   - Completely independent of Code Igniter (older versions could only be used in CI projects)
        - Now you can pass the CI AR instance to Hydrate directly.
        - You can also put the schema in the current.schema file directly, if you want (as opposed to
            only putting a pointer to the current schema file there. Putting a pointer also works.

1.2.2 - Fixed an error on MS SQL, which would come up, when there is limit() and more than one order_by()
1.2.1 - Allows to pass Hydrate->where() raw SQL queries in parentheses, i.e. Hydrate->where("(x AND y)")
1.2   - order_by() can now be called multiple times, to order by several fields
